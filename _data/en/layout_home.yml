  The CRI Code Club is a student’s association created in September 2016 at 
  the <a href="http://cri-paris.org" target="_blank">
  Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity</a> (Paris). 
  Our goal is to foster reflection around IT culture and teaching code through 
  diverse experimentations. We organize beginner’s programming workshops and longer project-based trainings.
