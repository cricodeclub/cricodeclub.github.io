    <p>The CRI Code Club is a student’s association created in September 2016 at  the <a href="http://cri-paris.org" target="_blank"> Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity</a> (Paris).  Our goal is to foster reflection around IT culture and teaching code through  diverse experimentations. We organize beginner’s programming workshops and longer project-based trainings.</p>

  <h1 id="a-code-club-in-paris">A code club, in Paris</h1>

<p>We organize open co-learning sessions every wednesday from 7pm to 9pm. Location: Tour Montparnasse, CRI, 20e étage, Computer room. 75015, Paris.</p>

<h2 id="our-actions">Our actions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We have developed the pedagogical axis of the club through introduction workshops to programming and web developing tools such as git. The workshops were organized at CRI and open to all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From January to April 2017, we carried out a project aiming to teach web integration to some students of Université Paris Descartes’ PaRéO diploma. The training was organized around the creation of a website allowing the students of the diploma to share their experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since February 2018, we are involving in a program (ReStart) that helps refugee learning code. We are offering for that a non-mandatory weekly co-learning session.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through these different training formats, we explore both different types of pedagogy (flipped classroom, project-based pedagogy) and different topics: programming languages, developing environment…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long term, we wish to develop a reflexive axis around IT culture (discriminations in the field of web development, free software culture…) through events such as hackathons and conferences.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>

<p>We are <a href="https://cri-paris.org/aire-edtech-master/">EdTech Master</a> students, an interdisciplinary master’s degree on research in innovation and education.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Louis started programming as a self-taught learned. After a two-year university degree in education sciences in the field of socio-educational uses of information and communication technology, he went on to pursue a professional bachelor’s degree in web development and connected objects mixing work and training. His pedagogical and technical skills allow him to have an overview of the field of code teaching. He likes free software culture and chicken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soizic discovered programming through French NGO Libraries Without Borders’ Code Travelers program. She wants to demystify programming and make its culture accessible to all, even those who do not wish to pursue a career in IT. A graduate in political science, she is particularly sensitive to the issues of discrimination in digital practices. She likes reddit and designers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
